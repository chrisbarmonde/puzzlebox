Features
* Store which direction player is facing
* Determine which coordinate the player is in at any given time
--> doing this, we won't have to rely on collisions, only checking for nearby blocks

Bugs
* Can jump if falling action not initiated from a jump (Need to check gravity calcs for downward motion)
